When I was in college I majored in astrophysics.  The program was essentially
the same as the physics program, except that almost all of your electives were
astrophysics courses.  Because of that, my senior year I had to choose between
taking general relativity and quantum field theory.  I had always been
fascinated by black holes so I took the GR course and watched my physics major
friends suffer through the QFT course from afar.  Consequently, I had a
QFT-sized gap in my physics and a few years ago I finally got around to trying
to remedy that.  I found that it took me a while to start to understand what
was going on.  The math, of course, is formidable, but more important, I found
that it was surprisingly difficult to find texts that even provided the
conceptual framework of the subject.  So I wanted to
